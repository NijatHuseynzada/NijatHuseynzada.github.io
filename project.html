              <p>The website is created by the Team 08. For the convenience of users, we decided to use light colors on our site. Our site consists of 4 parts, Homepage, About us, Hour of Code Event, and Website project. We used three programming languages in our project: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The team members of our team, Teymur Aliyev, worked About us and Website Project parts, and he used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Nijat Huseynzada worked Homepage part, and he used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Nazrin Muradova worked Hour of Code Event part, and she used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Each member of the 08 team studied HTML, JavaScript and CSS at codecademy.com to improve themselves.</p>
